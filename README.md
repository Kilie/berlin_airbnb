#### 2. It seems to be cheaper to stay on the weekend, while Wednesdays and Thursdays appear to be more expensive than the other days of the week. Also, shared rooms are not necessarily cheaper than private rooms! However, it's important to note that the error bars suggest that the differences among the days are not always statistically significant.

#### 3. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Mitte, and Pankow are among the most expensive districts on Airbnb Berlin, while Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Reinickendorf, and Steglitz-Zehlendorf are the cheapest. Overall, prices as well as supply vary drastically with different neighborhoods. Location Location Location!
